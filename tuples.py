Tuples

In addition to familiar types, Swift introduces advanced types not found in Objective-C, such as tuples.
Tuples enable you to create and pass around groupings of values.
You can use a tuple to return multiple values from a function as a single compound value.

Tuples group multiple values into a single compound value.
The values within a tuple can be of any type and don’t have to be of the same type as each other.

Tuples are useful for simple groups of related values.
They’re not suited to the creation of complex data structures.
If your data structure is likely to be more complex, model it as a class or structure, rather than as a tuple.
